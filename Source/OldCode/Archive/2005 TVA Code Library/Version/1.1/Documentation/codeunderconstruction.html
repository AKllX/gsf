				<TD>FTP Manager Component</TD>
				<TD>
					TDES includes an FTP management class built on top of the FTP library that handles multithreaded uploads and downloads -
					this makes it a high perforance full featured FTP client.  It would be nice if this were a stanfalone component.

				<TD>Add ReThrowExceptions property to SSAM api component</TD>
				<TD>
					Right now the SSAM api will trap all errors and set a success flag so that you can see if it succeeded or failed.
					This is fine for most uses, but in some cases it would be nice if "rethrew" the exception.
