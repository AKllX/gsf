<title>SSAM On-Call Support Information</title>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The System Status and Alarm Monitoring (SSAM) system
monitors critical ESO applications for timely data-flow performance, alerting
the on-call person via pager and email when expected data-flow events do not
occur within certain timeframe margins. This document details the procedures
defined for responding to SSAM alert notifications.</p>

<h1>What to Do When Paged</h1>

<p>When an on-call person is paged, the first thing to do is to
call the Operations center (SOC) and speak to the Shift Coordinator or
Associate (423.751.3586) to let them know that the notification was received. A
cell phone is provided as part of the on-call support materials for this
purpose. <b><i>This call should be made within fifteen (15) minutes of receiving the
page.</i></b> If the SOC does not hear from the on-call person within this
timeframe, he or she has been instructed to call the on-call person or the next
contact in the chain of responsibility.</p>

<p>In other words, if the on-call person does not respond to a
page from SSAM in a timely manner, the SOC Associate will escalate the contact
to supervisors.</p>

<p>There are only two exceptions to this:</p>

<ol>
 <li>When
     the SSAM monitor is forced to terminate and restart, it pages the on-call
     person to let him or her know that the SSAM monitor had to restart. This
     page is a "FYI" notification that does not require a response from the
     on-call person. Only network connectivity or database-access problems
     force the SSAM monitor to restart, and this typically occurs only once or
     twice per week under normal operating conditions. If the on-call person
     receives several ‘SSAM restarted’ pages in a relatively short timeframe,
     this may indicate (like a canary in a coal-mine) that the network and/or
     database are in a state which may soon cause more serious alerts.</li>
 <li>When
     all alarms have been cleared by successful operation of the system(s) in
     an alarm state, the SSAM monitor pages the on-call person to signal
     "all-clear", i.e. to inform the on-call person that the ESO applications
     are once again functioning within normal parameters [everything is back to
     normal, all OK, all alarms resolved, etc.]. This page is a "FYI"
     notification that does not require a response from the on-call person.</li>
</ol>

<p>For all other SSAM notifications, the on-call person should
contact the SOC Associate immediately.</p>

<h1>What Else to Do When Paged</h1>

<p>Once the SOC Associate has been contacted, the on-call
person should (directly, indirectly, or remotely) go to the SSAM website status
grid page <a href="http://opweb.cha.tva.gov/ssam/main.asp">http://opweb.cha.tva.gov/ssam/main.asp</a>
and drill-down on any alarm indicator lights (by clicking the red flashing
bubbles on the grid) to see what the problems are. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><i>Please note that the on-call
person should not acknowledge the alarms from this page; that is the
responsibility of the SOC Shift Associate</i></b> (to indicate to SSAM that the
SOC staff is aware of the alarm and prepared to implement contingency actions
if necessary).</p>

<p>Instead, the on-call person should go to the SSAM menu (<a
href="http://opweb.cha.tva.gov/ssam/SSAMmenu.asp">http://opweb.cha.tva.gov/ssam/SSAMmenu.asp</a>)
and click the "<b>Support Acknowledge
Alarms</b>" or "<b>Support Acknowledge All
Alarms</b>" button. This notifies SSAM that the on-call person is aware of the
current alarm(s).<b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> If this is not done, then SSAM will repeatedly page the on-call person
every fifteen (15) minutes to remind him/her that there are open alarms.</i></b>
If the on-call person is unable to access SSAM within a short timeframe, he or
she may request the Shift Associate to acknowledge the alarms on his/her
behalf. The Shift Associate’s SSAM menu includes a "Support Acknowledge Alarms"
button for this purpose, but the Associates will not click this button unless
asked by the on-call person.</p>
