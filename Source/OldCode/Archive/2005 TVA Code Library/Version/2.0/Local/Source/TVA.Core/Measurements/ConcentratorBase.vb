'  This class synchronizes (i.e., sorts by timestamp) real-time measurements
'
'  Note that your lag time should be defined as it relates to the rate at which data data is coming
'  into the concentrator. Make sure you allow enough time for transmission of data over the network
'  allowing any needed time for possible network congestion.
'
'  Code Modification History:
'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'  11/12/2004 - J. Ritchie Carroll
'       Generated initial version of source for Super Phasor Data Concentrator.
'  02/23/2006 - J. Ritchie Carroll
'       Abstracted classes for general use, and added to TVA code library.
'  04/23/2007 - J. Ritchie Carroll
'       Migrated concentrator to use a base class model instead of using delegates.
'  08/01/2007 - J. Ritchie Carroll
'       Completed extensive threading optimizations to ensure performance.
'  08/27/2007 - Darrell Zuercher
'       Edited code comments.
'  11/02/2007 - J. Ritchie Carroll
'       Changed code to use new FrameQueue class instead of KeyedProcessQueue to
'       allow more finite control of locking to reduce thread contention.
