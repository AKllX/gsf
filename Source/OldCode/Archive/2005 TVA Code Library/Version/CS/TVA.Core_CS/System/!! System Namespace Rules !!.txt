Very careful consideration should be taken when adding things to the .NET System namespace.
In general, the following rules should apply:

1) The object name should not conflict with any existing .NET objects.
2) The object should naturally extend the .NET libraries (as if item were missing from .NET).
3) Object should be pure and generally not rely on classes within TVA namespace
	a) Internally calling TVA functions within code would be OK (you're in the same assembly)
	b) Publically exposing anything within the TVA namespace would *not* be OK
	c) Items in this category may be considered for public domain publication
4) If item will naturally fit within TVA namespace, it may be better there instead.  Remember
   that anything added to this namespace "becomes" part of .NET and hence should be extremely
   well documented and compliment the .NET System namespace.
   
These are the rules.
