' James Ritchie Carroll - 2003
' 01/14/2005 JRC -
'       Moved bit constants into Bit class - made sense to me :p
'       Deprecated LShiftWord and RShiftWord since VB now supports << and >> operators
'       Converted other functions to use standard .NET bit conversion operations, this will
'           be more reliable and more OS portable than having to deal with the "sign" bit
'           as the older code was doing...
