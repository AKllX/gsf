' Steven Lowe - 2003
' 06/10/2004 JRC - Integrated into shared code library namespace TVA.Testing - renamed TvaTestClass to TestBase
' 06/10/2004 JRC - Made method name lookup beginning with "test" case insensitive
' 06/14/2004 JRC - Added a "test progress" method to allow logger to handle long tests (progress bar, DoEvents, etc.)
' 06/14/2004 JRC - Added a "test path" property for test components that need to test with files
' 06/15/2004 JRC - Added optional "RandomOrder" parameter to RunTests method to allow completely random test runs
' 09/02/2004 SAL - checked for and expose InnerException in test-case execution
Option Explicit On 

'	TestBase
'
'	This class provides a basic testing framework for inheritance by other test
'	classes. Its purpose is to provide an easy way to write tests for code
'	libraries independent of other projects, and to support automated regression
'	and stress testing.
'
'	To use this class, inherit from it and implement instance-level (not Shared)
'	public subs with no arguments whose names begin with "test". Each of these
'	subs should test one thing, feature, function, scenario, et al. Results of the
'	test are reported generically using the Assert() function to test a result
'	condition. Any number of conditions may be tested. For example:
'
'		Public Class MyTestClass
'			Inherits TestBase
'			Public Sub testSomething()
'				...	'do something
'				Assert(someCondition)	'test some result(s)
'				...	'do something else
'				Assert(someOtherCondition)	'test some more result(s)
'			End Sub
'		End Class
