//  Code Modification History:
//  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  06/01/2006 - Pinal C. Patel
//       Original version of source code generated
//  09/06/2006 - J. Ritchie Carroll
//       Added bypass optimizations for high-speed client data access
//  11/30/2007 - Pinal C. Patel
//       Modified the "design time" check in EndInit() method to use LicenseManager.UsageMode property
//       instead of DesignMode property as the former is more accurate than the latter
//  02/19/2008 - Pinal C. Patel
//       Added code to detect and avoid redundant calls to Dispose().
//  09/29/2008 - James R Carroll
//       Converted to C#.
