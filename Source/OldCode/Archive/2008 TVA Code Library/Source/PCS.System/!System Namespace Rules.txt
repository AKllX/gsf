Very careful consideration should be taken when adding objects to the .NET System namespace.
In general, the following rules should apply:

1) The object name should not conflict with any existing .NET objects.
2) The object should naturally extend the .NET libraries (as if item were missing from .NET).
3) Object should be pure and generally not rely on classes outside of system namespace.
4) If item will naturally fit within another namespace, put it there instead.  Remember
   that anything added to this namespace "becomes" part of .NET and hence should be
   extremely well documented and directly compliment the .NET System namespace.
