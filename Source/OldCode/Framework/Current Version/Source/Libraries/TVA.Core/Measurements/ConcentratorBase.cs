 1. DEFINITIONS

 A. "Contributor" means Government Agency, as the developer of the Original Software, and any entity
 that makes a Modification.

 software separate from the Subject Software that is not governed by the terms of this Agreement.

 F. "Modification" means any alteration of, including addition to or deletion from, the substance or
 structure of either the Original Software or Subject Software, and includes derivative works, as that
 term is defined in the Copyright Statute, 17 USC ยง 101. However, the act of including Subject Software
 as part of a Larger Work does not in and of itself constitute a Modification.

 G. "Original Software" means the computer software first released under this Agreement by Government
 Agency entitled openPDC, including source code, object code and accompanying documentation, if any.

 H. "Recipient" means anyone who acquires the Subject Software under this Agreement, including all
 Contributors.

 with respect to its own contribution to the Subject Software, hereby grants to each Recipient a
 non-exclusive, world-wide, royalty-free license to engage in the following activities pertaining to
 the Subject Software:

 1. Use

 2. Distribution

 3. Reproduction

 4. Modification

 5. Redistribution

 6. Display

 B. Under Patent Rights: Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Contributor, with
 respect to its own contribution to the Subject Software, hereby grants to each Recipient under Covered

 3. Reproduction

 4. Sale

 5. Offer for Sale

 C. The rights granted under Paragraph B. also apply to the combination of a Contributor's Modification
 and the Subject Software if, at the time the Modification is added by the Contributor, the addition of
 such Modification causes the combination to be covered by the Covered Patents. It does not apply to
 any other combinations that include a Modification. 

 D. The rights granted in Paragraphs A. and B. allow the Recipient to sublicense those same rights.
 Such sublicense must be under the same terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 3. OBLIGATIONS OF RECIPIENT

 A. Distribution or Redistribution of the Subject Software must be made under this Agreement except for
 additions covered under paragraph 3H. 

 1. Whenever a Recipient distributes or redistributes the Subject Software, a copy of this Agreement
 must be included with each copy of the Subject Software; and

 2. If Recipient distributes or redistributes the Subject Software in any form other than source code,
 Recipient must also make the source code freely available, and must provide with each copy of the
 Subject Software information on how to obtain the source code in a reasonable manner on or through a
 medium customarily used for software exchange.

 B. Each Recipient must ensure that the following copyright notice appears prominently in the Subject
 Software:

          No copyright is claimed pursuant to 17 USC ยง 105.  All Other Rights Reserved.

 C. Each Contributor must characterize its alteration of the Subject Software as a Modification and
 must identify itself as the originator of its Modification in a manner that reasonably allows
 subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Modification. In fulfillment of these
 requirements, Contributor must include a file (e.g., a change log file) that describes the alterations
 made and the date of the alterations, identifies Contributor as originator of the alterations, and
 consents to characterization of the alterations as a Modification, for example, by including a
 statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by
 Government Agency. Once consent is granted, it may not thereafter be revoked.

 D. A Contributor may add its own copyright notice to the Subject Software. Once a copyright notice has
 been added to the Subject Software, a Recipient may not remove it without the express permission of
 the Contributor who added the notice.

 E. A Recipient may not make any representation in the Subject Software or in any promotional,
 advertising or other material that may be construed as an endorsement by Government Agency or by any
 prior Recipient of any product or service provided by Recipient, or that may seek to obtain commercial
 advantage by the fact of Government Agency's or a prior Recipient's participation in this Agreement.

 F. In an effort to track usage and maintain accurate records of the Subject Software, each Recipient,
 upon receipt of the Subject Software, is requested to register with Government Agency by visiting the
 following website: https://naspi.tva.com/Registration/. Recipient's name and personal information
 shall be used for statistical purposes only. Once a Recipient makes a Modification available, it is
 requested that the Recipient inform Government Agency at the web site provided above how to access the
 Modification.

 G. Each Contributor represents that that its Modification does not violate any existing agreements,
 regulations, statutes or rules, and further that Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights
 conveyed by this Agreement.

 H. A Recipient may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity and/or
 liability obligations to one or more other Recipients of the Subject Software. A Recipient may do so,
 however, only on its own behalf and not on behalf of Government Agency or any other Recipient. Such a
 Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability
 obligation is offered by that Recipient alone. Further, such Recipient agrees to indemnify Government
 Agency and every other Recipient for any liability incurred by them as a result of warranty, support,
 indemnity and/or liability offered by such Recipient.

 I. A Recipient may create a Larger Work by combining Subject Software with separate software not
 governed by the terms of this agreement and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
 case, the Recipient must make sure Subject Software, or portions thereof, included in the Larger Work
 is subject to this Agreement.

 J. Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein, Recipient is hereby put on notice that export of
 any goods or technical data from the United States may require some form of export license from the
 U.S. Government. Failure to obtain necessary export licenses may result in criminal liability under
 U.S. laws. Government Agency neither represents that a license shall not be required nor that, if
 required, it shall be issued. Nothing granted herein provides any such export license.

 "AS IS."

 B. Waiver and Indemnity: RECIPIENT AGREES TO WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AGAINST GOVERNMENT AGENCY, ITS
 AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS, AS WELL AS ANY PRIOR RECIPIENT. IF RECIPIENT'S USE
 OF THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE RESULTS IN ANY LIABILITIES, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, EXPENSES OR LOSSES ARISING FROM
 SUCH USE, INCLUDING ANY DAMAGES FROM PRODUCTS BASED ON, OR RESULTING FROM, RECIPIENT'S USE OF THE
 SUBJECT SOFTWARE, RECIPIENT SHALL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS  GOVERNMENT AGENCY, ITS AGENTS,
 EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS, AS WELL AS ANY PRIOR RECIPIENT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY

 including, but not limited to, determining the validity of this Agreement, the meaning of its
 provisions and the rights, obligations and remedies of the parties.

 D. Entire Understanding: This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding and agreement of the
 parties relating to release of the Subject Software and may not be superseded, modified or amended
 except by further written agreement duly executed by the parties.

 E. Binding Authority: By accepting and using the Subject Software under this Agreement, a Recipient
 affirms its authority to bind the Recipient to all terms and conditions of this Agreement and that
 Recipient hereby agrees to all terms and conditions herein.
