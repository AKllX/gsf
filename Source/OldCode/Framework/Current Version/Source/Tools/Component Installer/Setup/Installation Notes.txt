Be sure to run "Setup.exe" to make sure all components get installed correctly (i.e., do not run the MSI files directly).

Visual Studio should not be running during installation of the component installer.

Click on "Tools / Refresh Code Library Components Tab" after installation in order to create the toolbox tab.
