' software separate from the Subject Software that is not governed by the terms of this Agreement.

' F. "Modification" means any alteration of, including addition to or deletion from, the substance or
' structure of either the Original Software or Subject Software, and includes derivative works, as that
' term is defined in the Copyright Statute, 17 USC § 101. However, the act of including Subject Software
' as part of a Larger Work does not in and of itself constitute a Modification.

' G. "Original Software" means the computer software first released under this Agreement by Government
' Agency entitled openPDC, including source code, object code and accompanying documentation, if any.

' H. "Recipient" means anyone who acquires the Subject Software under this Agreement, including all
' Contributors.

' respect to its own contribution to the Subject Software, hereby grants to each Recipient under Covered
' Patents a non-exclusive, world-wide, royalty-free license to engage in the following activities
' pertaining to the Subject Software:

' 1. Use

' 2. Distribution

' 3. Reproduction

' 4. Sale

' 5. Offer for Sale

' C. The rights granted under Paragraph B. also apply to the combination of a Contributor's Modification
' and the Subject Software if, at the time the Modification is added by the Contributor, the addition of
' such Modification causes the combination to be covered by the Covered Patents. It does not apply to
' any other combinations that include a Modification. 

' D. The rights granted in Paragraphs A. and B. allow the Recipient to sublicense those same rights.
' Such sublicense must be under the same terms and conditions of this Agreement.

' 3. OBLIGATIONS OF RECIPIENT

' A. Distribution or Redistribution of the Subject Software must be made under this Agreement except for
' additions covered under paragraph 3H. 

' 1. Whenever a Recipient distributes or redistributes the Subject Software, a copy of this Agreement
' must be included with each copy of the Subject Software; and

' 2. If Recipient distributes or redistributes the Subject Software in any form other than source code,
' Recipient must also make the source code freely available, and must provide with each copy of the
' Subject Software information on how to obtain the source code in a reasonable manner on or through a
' medium customarily used for software exchange.

' B. Each Recipient must ensure that the following copyright notice appears prominently in the Subject
' Software:

'          No copyright is claimed pursuant to 17 USC § 105.  All Other Rights Reserved.

' C. Each Contributor must characterize its alteration of the Subject Software as a Modification and
' must identify itself as the originator of its Modification in a manner that reasonably allows
' subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Modification. In fulfillment of these
' requirements, Contributor must include a file (e.g., a change log file) that describes the alterations
' made and the date of the alterations, identifies Contributor as originator of the alterations, and
' consents to characterization of the alterations as a Modification, for example, by including a
' statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by
' Government Agency. Once consent is granted, it may not thereafter be revoked.

' D. A Contributor may add its own copyright notice to the Subject Software. Once a copyright notice has
' been added to the Subject Software, a Recipient may not remove it without the express permission of
' the Contributor who added the notice.

' E. A Recipient may not make any representation in the Subject Software or in any promotional,
' advertising or other material that may be construed as an endorsement by Government Agency or by any
' prior Recipient of any product or service provided by Recipient, or that may seek to obtain commercial
' advantage by the fact of Government Agency's or a prior Recipient's participation in this Agreement.

' F. In an effort to track usage and maintain accurate records of the Subject Software, each Recipient,
' upon receipt of the Subject Software, is requested to register with Government Agency by visiting the
' following website: https://naspi.tva.com/Registration/. Recipient's name and personal information
' shall be used for statistical purposes only. Once a Recipient makes a Modification available, it is
' requested that the Recipient inform Government Agency at the web site provided above how to access the
' Modification.

' G. Each Contributor represents that that its Modification does not violate any existing agreements,
' regulations, statutes or rules, and further that Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights
' conveyed by this Agreement.

' H. A Recipient may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity and/or
' liability obligations to one or more other Recipients of the Subject Software. A Recipient may do so,
' however, only on its own behalf and not on behalf of Government Agency or any other Recipient. Such a
' Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability
' obligation is offered by that Recipient alone. Further, such Recipient agrees to indemnify Government
' Agency and every other Recipient for any liability incurred by them as a result of warranty, support,
' indemnity and/or liability offered by such Recipient.

' I. A Recipient may create a Larger Work by combining Subject Software with separate software not
' governed by the terms of this agreement and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
' case, the Recipient must make sure Subject Software, or portions thereof, included in the Larger Work
' is subject to this Agreement.

' J. Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein, Recipient is hereby put on notice that export of
' any goods or technical data from the United States may require some form of export license from the
' U.S. Government. Failure to obtain necessary export licenses may result in criminal liability under
' U.S. laws. Government Agency neither represents that a license shall not be required nor that, if
' required, it shall be issued. Nothing granted herein provides any such export license.

' RECIPIENT OF ANY RESULTS, RESULTING DESIGNS, HARDWARE, SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OR ANY OTHER APPLICATIONS
' RESULTING FROM USE OF THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE. FURTHER, GOVERNMENT AGENCY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND
' LIABILITIES REGARDING THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE, IF PRESENT IN THE ORIGINAL SOFTWARE, AND DISTRIBUTES IT
' "AS IS."

' B. Waiver and Indemnity: RECIPIENT AGREES TO WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AGAINST GOVERNMENT AGENCY, ITS
' AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS, AS WELL AS ANY PRIOR RECIPIENT. IF RECIPIENT'S USE
' OF THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE RESULTS IN ANY LIABILITIES, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, EXPENSES OR LOSSES ARISING FROM
' SUCH USE, INCLUDING ANY DAMAGES FROM PRODUCTS BASED ON, OR RESULTING FROM, RECIPIENT'S USE OF THE
' SUBJECT SOFTWARE, RECIPIENT SHALL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS  GOVERNMENT AGENCY, ITS AGENTS,
' EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS, AS WELL AS ANY PRIOR RECIPIENT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
' LAW.  THE FOREGOING RELEASE AND INDEMNIFICATION SHALL APPLY EVEN IF THE LIABILITIES, DEMANDS, DAMAGES,
' EXPENSES OR LOSSES ARE CAUSED, OCCASIONED, OR CONTRIBUTED TO BY THE NEGLIGENCE, SOLE OR CONCURRENT, OF
' GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR ANY PRIOR RECIPIENT.  RECIPIENT'S SOLE REMEDY FOR ANY SUCH MATTER SHALL BE THE
' IMMEDIATE, UNILATERAL TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

' 5. GENERAL TERMS
